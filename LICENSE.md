[ PREAMBLE ]
This License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a strict proprietary legal instrument governing the use, access, and distribution of the software Orlitx (the "Software"). The absolute ownership of this Software is held by ky_hello, while the operational management and enforcement of rights are conducted by the organization Cosmi Force (the "Organization"). Unlike permissive or copyleft licenses, this Agreement is designed to secure the intellectual property of the Organization and to prevent any unauthorized usage, duplication, or technical derivation. By accessing the Python source code or executing the Software, you (the "Licensee") are legally bound to every clause stipulated herein.

ARTICLE 1: OWNERSHIP AND DEFINITIONS
1.1 Definitions: "Software" refers to the entire Orlitx framework, including all .py files, compiled .pyc files, JSON configurations, internal APIs, and the "Cosmi Force" proprietary engine. "Derivatives" refer to any work based upon or containing any portion of the Software's logic, algorithms, or structural design.

1.2 Copyright Holder: All Python source code and algorithms associated with the Software are the exclusive intellectual property of ky_hello. This Software is licensed, not sold, and any unauthorized use or claim of ownership by any third party is strictly prohibited.

1.3 Trade Secrets: This Software is a collection of Trade Secrets belonging to the Organization. The Licensee is strictly prohibited from disclosing internal logic or architecture to third parties. Any improvements or modifications suggested by the Licensee shall automatically become the property of the Organization.

ARTICLE 2: GRANT OF LICENSE AND STRICT RESTRICTIONS
The Organization grants the Licensee a non-transferable license subject to the following strict prohibitions:

2.1 Anti-Reverse Engineering: You shall not decompile, disassemble, or reconstruct any part of the Python modules. Specifically, modifying core algorithms to create "forks" or competing tools is strictly prohibited.

2.2 Virtualization and Distribution: Running the Software in unauthorized virtual environments designed to bypass license verification is prohibited. Distribution to public repositories (e.g., GitHub) or private clouds without written consent from the Organization is strictly forbidden.

2.3 Integrity of Identification: You shall not remove or alter any copyright notices, "Cosmi Force" branding, or digital watermarks embedded within the source code or output headers.

ARTICLE 3: PLATFORM POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL COMPLIANCE
3.1 Discord TOS Compliance: The Licensee acknowledges that the use of Orlitx must comply with the Terms of Service (TOS) and Community Guidelines of Discord.

3.2 Mandatory Takedown: In the event that Discord Inc., or any governmental, law enforcement, or judicial body, issues a formal request or "Takedown Order" due to the nature of the Software, the Organization reserves the right to immediately delete all data and source code and block the Licensee's access without prior notice.

ARTICLE 4: EMERGENCY KILL-SWITCH AND FORCED DISABLEMENT
4.1 Kill-Switch Authorization: The Software contains a built-in "Remote Kill-Switch" mechanism. The Organization reserves the unilateral right to activate this switch in response to legal or platform-specific deletion requests.

4.2 Effect of Activation: Upon activation, the Software will immediately cease to function and may initiate a self-deletion or locking sequence of its core modules to prevent further use.

4.3 Indemnification for Deletion: The Organization shall not be held liable for any data loss, service interruption, or damages resulting from the enforcement of these security measures or the permanent disablement of the Software.

ARTICLE 5: AUDIT AND LEGAL RELIEF
5.1 Right to Audit: The Organization reserves the right to audit the Licensee’s use of the Software and may utilize "Phone-home" technical verification to ensure compliance.

5.2 Injunctive Relief: The Licensee acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the Organization. Therefore, the Organization shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief (court orders) to stop any unauthorized use or leak.

ARTICLE 6: DISCLAIMER AND TERMINATION
6.1 No Warranty: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES. ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE AND USAGE ARE ASSUMED BY THE LICENSEE.

6.2 Automatic Termination: Failure to comply with any provision of this License shall result in the immediate and automatic termination of your rights. Upon termination, you must destroy all electronic and physical copies of Orlitx.
